# CONCR: A CONtrastive learning framework for Causal Reasoning
CONCR ia a CONtrastive learning framework for Causal Reasoning that advances state-of-the-art causal reasoning on the e-CARE dataset. CONCR is a model-agnostic framework and works better with better sentence encoders. It discards the projection in previous contrastive learning frameworks and uses cosine similarity to score the causal relationship between one premise and one hypothesis. CONCR achieves 77.58% accuracy on BERT-base-uncased and 78.75% on RoBERTa-base, improving previous work by 2.40% and 4.08% respectively.
